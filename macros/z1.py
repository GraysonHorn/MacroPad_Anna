# MACROPAD Hotkeys example: Tones

# The syntax for Tones in macros is highly peculiar, in order to maintain
# backward compatibility with the original keycode-only macro files.
# The third item for each macro is a list in brackets, and each value within
# is normally an integer (Keycode), float (delay) or string (typed literally).
# Consumer Control codes were added as list-within-list, and then mouse and
# tone further complicate this by adding dicts-within-list. Each tone-related
# item is the key 'tone' with either an integer frequency value, or 0 to stop
# the tone mid-macro (tone is also stopped when key is released).
# Helpful: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies

# This example ONLY shows tones (and delays), but really they can be mixed
# with other elements (keys, codes, mouse) to provide auditory feedback.
